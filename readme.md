# Esperanto-English dictionary for Kindle

## Source

This dictionary is compiled from the following sources:

* Ergane, from https://www.esperanto-panorama.net/vortaro/eoen.htm
* ESPDIC, from http://www.denisowski.org/Esperanto/ESPDIC/espdic_readme.html
* DictionaryForMIDS Eo-Eng, from https://sourceforge.net/projects/dictionarymid/files/

The methodology was as follows:

* Combine the entries of the above dictionaries into a superset of Esperanto words.
* Discard duplicate definitions.
* Concatenate alternate definitions where more than one remain.
* Add inflected versions of the words to the resulting dictionary (e.g. pomojn for pomo, kuŝus for kuŝi).

The dictionary was then created using apeyser's tab2opf.py from https://github.com/apeyser/tab2opf and Amazon's kindlegen tool. (Note: The kindlegen tool has been removed, and replaced with Kindle Previewer, which I have not tested.)

## Download

The latest version (ver 2.0) of the .mobi file can be found [here](https://github.com/coljac/kindle_eo_eng/releases/tag/ver2_0_1), or compiled according to the above.

## Installation

Email it to your kindle, or copy to Kindle in the Documents/dictionaries folder. 

The metadata on the dictionary should now have the correct language. If there are any problems, the dictionary can be selected manually.
