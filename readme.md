# Esperanto-English dictionary for Kindle

## Source

This dictionary is compiled from the following sources:

Ergane, from https://www.esperanto-panorama.net/vortaro/eoen.htm
ESPDIC, from http://www.denisowski.org/Esperanto/ESPDIC/espdic_readme.html
DictionaryForMIDS Eo-Eng, from https://sourceforge.net/projects/dictionarymid/files/

The methodology was as follows:

- Combine the entries of the above dictionaries into a superset of Esperanto words.
- Discard duplicate definitions.
- Concatenate alternate definitions where more than one remain.
- Create duplicate entries for inflected versions of nouns, verbs and adjectives (e.g. pomojn for pomo, kuŝus for kuŝi)

The dictionary was then created using apeyser's tab2opf.py from https://github.com/apeyser/tab2opf and Amazon's kindlegen tool.

## Download

The latest version of the .mobi file can be found [here](https://coljac.space/Esperanto-English.mobi), or compiled according to the above.

## Installation

Email it to your kindle, or copy to Kindle in the Documents/dictionaries folder. 

I haven't experimented properly with the proper auto-detection of the kindle language, but when reading an Esperanto document, it will at least prompt you to select a dictionary, and this will show up in the menu.
